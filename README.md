# C++ Expression Templates

## Description
This repository demonstrates the power of **Expression Templates** in C++ â€” a technique used to optimize numerical computations using metaprogramming. Expression Templates allow you to represent mathematical formulas in a way that compiles to efficient code by avoiding unnecessary temporaries and loops.

The code constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) at compile-time, which is then evaluated either during compilation or at runtime. This approach is especially beneficial for optimizing performance in mathematical and scientific computations.

## Key Features
- **Expression Templates**: A technique to optimize numeric calculations by leveraging C++ metaprogramming.
- **Custom Operations**: Supports common mathematical operations like addition, multiplication, absolute value, and more.
- **Compile-Time Optimization**: Builds an abstract syntax tree at compile-time for faster evaluation at runtime.

## How It Works
1. **Terminal Nodes**: Represent leaf elements (variables) in the AST.
2. **Operation Nodes**: Represent mathematical operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) on the tree's children.
3. **Expression Evaluation**: The tree is evaluated recursively, leveraging C++'s template system to optimize operations.
